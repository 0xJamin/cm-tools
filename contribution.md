# Contributing Guidelines

- Add a single resource in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- Pull request title should include resource name and resource section.
  - Example: `[Quillbot] -> [AI Paraphrasing tool]`

- Provide a link to the submitted resource in the pull request comment section for easier access without copy paste.
  - Example: `Link: https://quillbot.com/`

- Double-check if the resource is truly free or paid
